# Churn-Risk-Modeling-for-Banking-Clients
Description: This project involves analyzing customer churn in a banking environment, focusing on identifying customers who are likely to leave the bank. The project applies various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to predict churn. It also uses techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance in the data, ensuring accurate predictions. The analysis helps in understanding key factors driving customer churn, such as demographics, account activity, and service usage.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset and performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed demographic factors and customer behaviors leading to churn.

Machine Learning Models: Used 7 models to predict churn, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, with performance evaluation via metrics like ROC curve and accuracy score.

Class Imbalance Handling: Utilized SMOTE to balance the dataset, improving model performance on the minority class.

Insights: Provided actionable insights for the bank to improve customer retention by targeting high-risk customers.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SMOTE, Jupyter Notebook.
